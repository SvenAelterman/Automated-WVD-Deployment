# Azure Blueprints
[Azure Bluprints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) are exported as a JSON template and stored on VA's Commercial GitHub.

Link to Github.

## What steps happen to make it ready?
Azure Blueprints provides a template for creating the required infrastructure to support the VA's Windows Virtual Desktop in a new subscription. This automated approach will programmatically create and configure the subscription. This can be done via the Azure portal or Powershell.

**Blueprints:**
* CreateWVDRGs
    * 16 Resource Groups for WVD HostPools and respective Session Hosts.
    * 1 Mgmt. Resource Group which contains:
        * Log Analtyics Workspace
        * Storage Account
        * KeyVault
* NIST 800-53
* VNETandSubs
    * Networking Resource Group
    * VNET
    * Subnets
    * Default Route Table

## Azure Automation Runbooks
There is a Core Automation Account that will do the core work such as updating Route Tables, scaling up and down the WVD infrastructure and more.
### Components:
* Automation Account
  * wvd-core-int-east-automation
     * AAD Service Principal as RunAs
     * Contributor at WVD-All Management Level
* Runbooks can be imported from GitHub
  * Update_Route_Tables
  * Scaling of WVD infrastructure
  * Any more needed.    

## Azure Function App
There is a Function App created that gathers necessary perf metrics that are reported on and used for alerting.  This will inject custom mentrics to Azure Monitor.
### Components:
* Function App
    * Name: wvdmetrics
    * Interval: 5 mins    

## Steps to Create New subscription 
> (At this time the subscription must be manually created)
> 
* A Cloud account is already created in commercial AAD (**sub-owner@dvagov.onmicrosoft.com**)
* Account is disabled and must be enabled with new credentials generated (Harvey Hayes owns this process)
* Authenticate to the [EA Portal](https://ea.azure.com) using cloud account
* Create new subscription and this will take you to the Azure portal once complete.
* Find your newly created subscription and rename to match naming scheme. 
  	* EX: _WVD-Public-External-xx_
* Once completed, contact Harvey Hayes to let him know work completed and to disable account

### Portal
  * Login to the Azure Portal, navigate to Management Groups(You must have appropriate permissions to see and manage for the following steps).

  * Follow the steps above required for the blueprint.  
      * You will need to fill out the "Resource Group Name" field, using standard nameing conventions.
